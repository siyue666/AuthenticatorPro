**This section should be deleted before you submit your request, but it's worth knowing we only add icons as per our [Contribution Guidelines:](https://github.com/stratumauth/app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)**

> - Platforms that use a 'Single Sign-On' should have the icon added for the sign-on account and not for the individual platforms. Eg: instead of a YouTube icon a Google icon would be needed, or instead of a Photoshop icon an Adobe icon should be used  
> - Web based platforms should be within [Similarweb's](https://www.similarweb.com) top 200,000 global rank. [Simply search for the site and see for yourself](https://www.similarweb.com).
> - Mobile platforms should have at least 100k+ downloads on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/). 
> - If the service is not web based or on the Play Store it will have to be reviewed individually, in which case it's best to just [submit a request as a issue.](https://github.com/stratumauth/app/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=icon_request.md&title=)

If you're in any doubt, there's no harm in submitting your request anyways and we'll take a look!
